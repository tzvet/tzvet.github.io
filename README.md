Here you can find some descriptions of work related stuff and links to code, posted free and "AS IS" (see the related license posted with the code).

### "Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in Humans" for the experimental design of [D.Tadin](http://www2.bcs.rochester.edu/sites/duje/) as used in the Nature (2003, 424:312-315) [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01800)
- I wrote a Research Advance manuscript for eLife, improving the paper "Suppression and facilitation of human neural responses" by [Schallmo et al.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/30334)
- I submitted a [bioRxiv manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/465807v1) to eLife, and it was rejected at the editorial stage. [This code](https://github.com/tzvet/Data-Model-MotionSuppressionFacilitation-2018) goes with my manuscript "Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in humans".
- The submission created a 3-way interaction between me, Drs Schallmo & Murray, and the Editorial Board of eLife, with result: the manuscript being rejected. Drs Schallmo & Murray wrote a [concern](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/495291v1) as a reply to my manuscript, and I answered them [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01574). After the final decision from eLife, I commented on [pubpeer.com](https://pubpeer.com/publications/54A0746E8265090D11950DD2ECEFB7) about the issues of "reviewing" and scientific discussion setup by eLife & bioRxiv.
- The code remains free (i.e. in the sense of the GPLv3) and openly available to people interested in this experimental design. The zip file contains the data and code (Octave; www.octave.org) for fitting the data with the model described in the manuscript, and creating the figures.
