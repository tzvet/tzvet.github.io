### Motion suppression and facilitation in the experimental design of [D.Tadin](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01800) (Nature, 2003, 424:312-315)

- A [bioRxiv manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/465807v1) was submitted to eLife, and rejected at the editorial stage. [This code at my github repository](https://github.com/tzvet/Data-Model-MotionSuppressionFacilitation-2018) presents the code that goes with the manuscript "Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in humans". The submission created a 3-way interaction between me, Drs Schallmo & Murray, and the Editorial Board of eLife, with result: the manuscript being rejected. Drs Schallmo & Murray wrote a ["concern"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/495291v1) as a reply to my manuscript, and I answered them [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01574). After the final decision from eLife, I commented on the issues of "reviewing" and scientific discussion setup by eLife & bioRxiv [here](https://pubpeer.com/publications/54A0746E8265090D11950DD2ECEFB7).
- The code remains free (i.e. in the sense of the GPLv3) and openly available to people interested in this experimental design. The zip file contains the data and code (Octave; www.octave.org) for fitting the data with the model described in the manuscript, and creating the figures.
