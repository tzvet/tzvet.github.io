I am a researcher. My scientific curriculum pages:
- at [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2553-4741)
- at [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tzvetomir_Tzvetanov)
- at [Loop-Frontiers](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/17380/overview)

Here you can find some descriptions of work related stuff.

The following points are present:
- Link to a [document](#bernsteinfellow2008) concerning my work period during the first half of 2008 as Bernstein Fellow
- Commentaries and discussion about my publication [“Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in Humans” (Tzvetanov, 2018, bioRxiv)](#tzvetanov2019schallmo2018) adn what happened in trying to publish it in the journal eLife

### Period from January to April 2008 as Bernstein Fellow, and until June 2008 in Goettingen <a name="bernsteinfellow2008"></a> ###
- I had difficulties to establish my work contract for carrying in Goettingen my own independent project that was financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
- Instead of my DFG financed grant, I found myself as a "super" postdoc with the title "Bernstein Fellow" at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Goettingen
- This [pdf document in english](./document_pour_periode_BCCN2008_tzvetanov_5.pdf) gives my account about the events that happened and clarifies multiple errors about my Bernstein Fellow period, and around it, disseminated publicly by the BCCN Goettingen
- (*addition on June 3rd 2020*) I informed on November 1st 2019 different parties (8 persons) that were cited in the above document about its presence. Since then I did not have any communication about the BCCN issue with any person. In the email, I wrote a statement about communication on the issue about the BCCN from their side, or an intermediary contacting me on their behalf. **From now on, Wednesday June 3rd 2020, I make the statement in the email public and its validity generalises to any person that communicates with me about this BCCN period.** The statement is:
> > After this email, any communication from your side about the BCCN that I receive
> > could be made public at my own will.
> > 
> > This means, if you send me any communication about the BCCN, from now on, you accept and agree
> > that it can be made public by me at my own will, irrespective of what you state in it.
> > 
> > This means, if some person, or organisation, takes contact and communicates about the BCCN with
> > me on behalf of your name or your organisation, you accept and agree that all
> > communications I receive from that person, or organisation, on your behalf can be
> > made public by me at my own will, irrespective of what is stated in it. It is your
> > responsibility to inform any other party communicating with me on your behalf
> > that any of their communications enter into the above rule.

### "Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in Humans" for the experimental design of [D.Tadin](http://www2.bcs.rochester.edu/sites/duje/) as used in the Nature (2003, 424:312-315) [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01800)  <a name="tzvetanov2019schallmo2018"></a> ###
- I wrote a Research Advance manuscript for eLife, improving the paper "Suppression and facilitation of human neural responses" by [Schallmo et al.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/30334)
- I submitted a [bioRxiv manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/465807v1) to eLife, and it was rejected at the editorial stage. [This code](https://github.com/tzvet/Data-Model-MotionSuppressionFacilitation-2018) goes with my manuscript "Suppression and facilitation of motion perception in humans".
- The submission created a 3-way interaction between me, Drs Schallmo & Murray, and the Editorial Board of eLife, with result: the manuscript being rejected. Drs Schallmo & Murray wrote a [concern](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/495291v1) as a reply to my manuscript, and I answered them [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01574). After the final decision from eLife, I commented on [pubpeer.com](https://pubpeer.com/publications/54A0746E8265090D11950DD2ECEFB7) about the issues of "reviewing" and scientific discussion setup by eLife & bioRxiv.
- The code remains free (i.e. in the sense of the GPLv3) and openly available to people interested in this experimental design. The zip file contains the data and code (Octave; www.octave.org) for fitting the data with the model described in the manuscript, and creating the figures.
