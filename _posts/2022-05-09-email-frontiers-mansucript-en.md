For now, Monday 9th May 2022, I have received responses from the two Topic Editors on Monday 3rd May 2022. These are pasted below.

I noted also :  

* a change in the Review Forum, with Dr. Adam Reeves being associated editor of the submission; [see screen capture](/fichiersdivers/capture-20220509-frontlocalglobal-editorialassignment.jpg).  
* that my former USTC email account (tzvetan@ustc.edu.cn), which is still working and I put in Cc to my [Email](https://tzvet.github.io/blog/2022/05/02/email-frontiers-mansucript-en), was not used in the replies.

Dear Dr. Tzvetanov,

I totally share Prof. Reeves’s words. I agree to cancel the submission.

Sorry for this unfortunate and painful dispute.

Kind regards,
