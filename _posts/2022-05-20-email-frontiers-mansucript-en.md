Friday 13th May 2022, I received the decision of rejection by the Specialty Chief Editor, Dr. Jae Kun Shim. It is pasted at the bottom.

On the same day, I received an email from Dr. Jinfeng Huang. Following the first post about this manuscript ([see here](https://tzvet.github.io/blog/2022/05/02/email-frontiers-mansucript-en)), all procedures will continue to follow the written statement made be me in that first email and post.
