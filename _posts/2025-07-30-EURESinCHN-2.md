title: Weixin group "Nice European Researchers" chat history [fr,en]
date: 2025-07-30
---

Le 26 mars 2024, par invitation avec code QR, j'ai rejoint un groupe Wechat nommé "Nice European Researchers".

L'origine de ce deuxième groupe de chercheurs européens en Chine semble être une sorte de trollisation du premier groupe, que j'ai quitté à la fin du mois de mars 2024 [voir 1] suite à ce que je considérais comme une activité trop peu liée à l'intérêt de la majorité.

Dans ce deuxième groupe, j'y ai posté quelques commentaires.

Comme je trouve que, depuis, la situation générale ne s'est pas améliorée, que ce deuxième groupe est extrêmement tranquille, et que certains commentaires que j'y ai mis me paraissent importants, je publie donc aussi mes posts de ce groupe.

Bon courage à tous.

Hello to all newcomers! [Smile]  
on the other hand, I am sorry to see so many people leaving the other group. But I don't feel so much Rogue anymore... [Slight]  
btw, anyone knows of a group discussing possible use of wechat AI in groups for disturbing the groups (harassment). I've stumbled on smthg very strange. Need to discuss it with people.

Not wechat per se.

People programming AI for disturbing groups

Mimicking other people's behavior and writings style

Well, not that. @X

I read this book this summer. It talks also about Wechat's surveillance system. At one point, the author states that he met in person with one wechat person with whom they talked about some topics in private messages. They compared the private messages they exchanged; their wechat messages did not completely match. Some replies sent to the author were missing.

Many questions came up to my mind; e.g. how far they can use AI to manipulate groups, especially when one knows, as X pointed, that you can start some lengthy "useless" topic with a simple comment... but to develop this issue is for another group. just wanted to know if anyone has heard of such a thing and groups talking about this issue.

It's Baidu vs openAI, Ernie vs Chatgpt. So, this is why I am worried. Including all your comments just above. I think these things have been developed far far ahead of what I (we) could imagine. And if a journalist writes in a book, published beginning 2023, that his PM with another were modified, in their case simply deleted, how far can it go? It's very worrying... please, let's keep this group about Research and other common issues that are of general interest.

@all Hello ! Just a question: I find smthg very strange. New people are added to this group (one on 03/20 and one on 04/05), which is nice, but I see extremely small activity in the group. Quasi no messages !? Since January, there are 4 posts ! Am I the only one to wonder why new comers arrive to almost no active group ?!? Or simply my wechat is completely bugged and manipulated, a possiblity I posted on Sept 9 2024 ?

赐为-Tzvetomir 17:38  
sorry, sept. 11th, 2024

赐为-Tzvetomir 21:06  
[Smile] I agree. I was just wondering/worrying that it's soo quite, no news; But that's my conspiracy paranoia. sorry for that [Trick]

@X. @X Sadly, you are both right. For X, yes, the program looks exciting, like the one in sept.2019; Given what I said during the talks I had with 4 colleagues after the meeting, during "la troiseme mi-temps", at a bar in Beijing, (one British, one Spanish, one Greek, one French, +me), my conclusion, months or even year(s) later, is that all these infos were used by some EU factions; and now, I interpret the behaviour of the Brit'guy, when he said he had to leave, as being scared from what i was describing happened around me (in sept.2019!). When the new EU Ambassador, that succeeded Nicolas Chapuis, was known, I considered it as confirming my suspicion(s) that all was about gathering infos about what's happening, but only for few "selected ones", factions or groups using it for themselves; and later, I heared/learned that the new "EU ambassador" is a total supporter of nato ?!?!  
Comme on dit en France, j'ai l'impression d'etre entre le marteau et l'enclume;  
Please take care and be careful !
